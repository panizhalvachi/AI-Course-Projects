    "In this section, We want you to implement another A* algorithm which is named **anytime weighted A*** in this algorithm, and we take the initial state of the game, heuristic function, weight, and timebound as inputs which **weight** is the factor which determines the impact of heuristic in calculating f_value (g + w\\*h) and **timebound** is the number of seconds that we have for running this algorithm. And Output of this function is a **goal state of search** (if a goal is found), else **FALSE**. <br/>\n",
    "In this version of A*, we aim to find the optimal path and optimal goal. So while there is time, we call the search method of the search engine (**se**) and we look for a path with minimum cost and to save time, We use cost-bounder to prune states which have bigger f_value than the best path cost we found so far. Costbounder is a three tuple that is like (g_val, h_val, g_val + h_val) which each of these 3 are like limit for pruning successor state. Please pay attention that in this version, we prune only when the current final f is larger than best_path_cost<br/>\n",
    "As you can see in the function below, first we save the f_value function, which is affected by weight, into **wrapped_fval_function** then we make a search engine and call its **init_search**. <br/>\n",
    "For calculating goal value to compare with best path cost that was found, We use **final.gval + heur_fn(final)** which **final** is the goal state in case is found."
